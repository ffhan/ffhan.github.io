<hr/>
<p>
    Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving
    it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a
    second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each
    player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.
